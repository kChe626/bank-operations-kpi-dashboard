## **Overview**  
This project builds an operational performance dashboard for a bank’s contact center, focusing on efficiency, conversion performance, and customer segment trends.
It uses Python for preprocessing, SQL for KPI aggregation, and Power BI for a multi-page, interactive operations dashboard.

---

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** [bank_cleaned_operational.csv](https://github.com/kChe626/Bank_Marketing/blob/main/bank.csv)  
- **Columns:** customer demographics, contact channel, call duration, conversion outcome, age band, job role, and operational flags (repeat contact, follow-up, prior contact)

---

## **Objectives**
- Clean and prepare operational contact center data for SQL analysis
- Aggregate KPIs by month, week, contact channel, age band, and job role    
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor operational efficiency and conversion outcomes
---

## **Data Cleaning Process (Python)**
**Key Steps:**
- Standardized column names for SQL compatibility
- Replaced placeholder values (e.g., 'unknown') with NULL
- Parsed and validated date fields into a reliable date format
- Converted flags into numeric indicators (0/1)
- Exported cleaned dataset for SQL aggregation

**Example Snippets:**  
```python
# Replace 'unknown' with NaN
df.replace('unknown', np.nan, inplace=True)

# Create parsed date column
df['date_parsed'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], errors='coerce')

# Convert flag fields to integers
flag_cols = ['converted', 'is_repeat_contact', 'is_followup', 'had_prior_contact']
df[flag_cols] = df[flag_cols].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce').fillna(0).astype(int)

```

## **SQL Analysis**
**Objectives:**
- Calculate total contacts, conversions, and conversion rate over time
- Measure average call handling time and repeat/follow-up contact rates
- Break down KPIs by contact channel, age band, and job role

**Example Queries:**
```sql
-- Monthly KPI overview
SELECT
    ym,
    COUNT(*) AS total_contacts,
    SUM(converted_i) AS conversions,
    ROUND(100 * SUM(converted_i) / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0), 2) AS conversion_rate_pct,
    ROUND(AVG(call_seconds_n), 1) AS avg_call_seconds,
    ROUND(100 * AVG(is_repeat_contact_i), 2) AS repeat_contact_rate_pct
FROM v_ops_base
WHERE date_final IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ym
ORDER BY ym;

-- Channel performance
SELECT
    ym,
    COALESCE(contact, 'unknown') AS contact_channel,
    COUNT(*) AS total_contacts,
    ROUND(100 * SUM(converted_i)/NULLIF(COUNT(*),0), 2) AS conversion_rate_pct
FROM v_ops_base
GROUP BY ym, contact_channel
ORDER BY ym, contact_channel;
```

## **Key Insights**
- Repeat contact and follow-up rates provide insight into service efficiency
- Average call handling time highlights resource and process optimization opportunities
- Seasonal patterns in contact activity can inform staffing and campaign timing

---
## **Dashboard Pages**
1. Executive Ops Overview — High-level KPIs, trends, and monthly detail table
2. Channel Performance — Volume and conversion trends by contact channel
3. Age Band Analysis — Segment performance by customer age group
4. Job Role Targeting — Conversion efficiency and contact volume by job category    
---
## **How to Open**
1. Download the Power BI dashboard: [Bank_Operation.pbix](https://github.com/kChe626/Bank_Marketing/blob/main/bank_power_bi.pbix)  
2. Open in Power BI Desktop  
3. Use slicers to filter by date range, channel, age band, or job role
---

## **Use Cases**
- Contact Center Management: Track efficiency, reduce repeat contacts, and optimize resource allocation
- Process Improvement: Identify channels or segments with low conversion rates for targeted interventions
- Staffing & Scheduling: Align workforce planning with seasonal and weekly performance patterns
- Strategic Planning: Use KPI trends to guide service and marketing decisions
  
---

## **Business Relevance**
By integrating operational KPIs into a single interactive dashboard, this project enables data-driven operations management.
The insights help reduce inefficiencies, improve customer experience, and support strategic decision-making in a banking environment.
